# 1. What does this project do? 
-project Name : Health Index Check Server (My Health Caculator :MHC)
-project do:This web server is an open source server that measures a person's personal information (especially his or her weight and height) and checks his or her health index.In particular, it measures BMI index and obesity level and suggests appropriate weight accordingly.Also, it is an open source web server that has a role as a weight control index program that tells you how much weight you need to lose or how much you need to increase.

# 2. Why is this project useful? 
:We usually don't seem to be very good at using our body's health intelligence figures.
Desire and interest in diet or healthy body is high, but if you are overweight or obese, you aim only to lose weight without knowing exactly how much you should lose or what your weight is right.
Therefore, we need this web server more and more.
The first reason for this is that this web service is useful in that it is not used well despite simple health check using body health index.
Second, it is useful not only for overweight obesity but also for underweight or normal standards.
I think it is valuable not only in reducing weight, but also in that it accurately presents the standard of the summit or accurately informs you when you are underweight to prevent excessive weight loss.
And finally, it is useful in that it gives users more visible health index results by presenting their current health status as a starting image based on the obesity index.

# 3. How do I get started?
:The idea of building this web service began with the experience of using the obesity calculator provided by existing portal sites.
The existing obesity calculation service, although it tells the obesity level and current condition, was cumbersome and inconvenient to check again because it did not suggest my standard weight and how much weight I had to lose or increase to achieve proper weight. Therefore, we can say that this project started with the idea of creating a web server that improved this part.
# 4. Where can I get more help, if i need it?
:The part that I want to develop further in this project is to make the first web page more visually pleasing, and secondly, I want to develop it into a project that presents more diverse levels of diabetes and hypertension through additional health indicators (e.g., blood sugar levels, blood pressure).
Therefore, to do so, I think it would be good to get help from each open source website such as visually developing using batflat or other open sources and managing databases using myadmine.
